### The dataset is hosted on Hugginface Hub and can be accessed [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/hieunguyenminh/roleplay-llm-65aaaf61c2eef2ba117f4ecf)

### The Dataset is generated by multiple models such as Gemini Pro (Google), GPT 3.5, Mistral Medium.

### The dataset is used to fine-tune the models to generate conversational AI to embody a wide range of original characters, each with a unique persona. It includes fictional characters, complete with their own backgrounds, core traits, relationships, goals, and distinct speaking styles.
